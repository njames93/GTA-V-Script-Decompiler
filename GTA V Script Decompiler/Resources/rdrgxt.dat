It is in our judgement that many repeater manufacturers exact a high profit on repeaters, as do retailers, however as we are the CHEAPEST SUPPLY HOUSE ON EARTH we strive to make sure that you have the weapons you need to guard the fidelity of your cattle or daughter with equal measure.

I ordered the Lancaster Varmint Rifle from your outfit for my boy's birthday and one night I set a spell listening for them coons to go a walkin' about. I woke up my boy with a crack of that rifle outside his window and he came a galloping outside in a hurry and we headed out towards the barn. I told him to cut the light and we set there till we saw them beady eyes reflected by the moon. Boy howdy if he didn't have a mess of fun shooting that whole family of coons dead. I remembered my pa used to parboil coon with sweet potatoes. Doggone if we didn't have ourselves a feast that night. I can't thank you enough for recommending this fine rifle. It's a hoot.”~n~

When wild animals, bandits or Indians threaten your safety on the trail you can do no better than purchasing this high grade double barrel shotgun. So easy to use a child can ride next to the driver and fire with abandon. John Sprewell of Blackwater says, “No finer gun have I purchased in all my years riding the coach to San Francisco. It is so easy to use, a child can ride next to the driver and fire with abandon. I often bring my boy with me while making the stagecoach journey so that he learns how to interact with others. Rather than spend time book learning, he is better learning the real things a man needs to know – like how to be alone for days and weeks at a time under the hot sun, being wary of strangers and keeping a gun at the ready should any foolishness occur.”~n~

Or that a squib load has resulted in catastrophe and loss of an eye. We take great pleasure in informing our customers that this is in no way the fault of the catalogue house, manufacturer, nor intermediaries. It is due to carelessness and neglect on the part of the owner, who may use a weapon and then put it by the side of the front door or bathroom, or lay it on a rock and become inebriated. Pitting and spots inside the barrel can be easily prevented by cleaning and oiling rifle barrels after shooting. It is a foolish man that does not treat his tools with the utmost respect, for they put meat on the table and command respect from others. If pitting does occur, we must charge $1.50 to re-bore and re-polish. Using gun oil, cleaning and boring, and keeping your rifle in a cool dry place such as under your pillow will result in safety and satisfaction for many years of u

I suspect laudanum or some opium was the base of that tincture, for they were suddenly rabid in possessing more of the cure. I returned home in the autumn to find them taking more and more doses of that vile concoction, mama pounding the hymnal with her crooked hands and singing to the ceiling Psalms of one kind or the other.

If you wish for men truly to be free - if that is this nation's promise and not merely a sales pitch for snake oil - then we must first teach ourselves and then our fellows to see the glory.

When the U.S. Army's 7th 5th Cavalry and the honorable Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Everett Yarbrough sought to discuss matters peacefully, a skirmish broke out, and thanks to the Henry Repeater, many of the combatants were killed. Sadly, Yarbrough was not supplied with enough Henry Repeaters and all perished that day. We offer this repeating rifle as a memento to the brave men that perished defending decency, honor, gold and oil prospecting and working in an effort to bring civilization to the uncivilized. It is a welcome addition to any wagon train, homestead, or cattleman. Bloody skirmishes by Indians occur daily in this country, and only one rifle will protect you and your family where others are doome

The barrels on these guns are genuine laminated steel and no other house will give you the guarantee on a gun at such a price. It is a gun that will last for years and give the most satisfaction. We even heard from one man who lives by the river that he has used it not only for hunting but for fishing, having grown tired of the onerous wait and deadening quiet spent by the mouth of the river. Instead, he waits until a flash of silver appears in the water and unloads, often delighting in the pieces of a fish or strange beast that surfaces, scooping them up and making the most delightful of stews with the entrails.

Despair may be picturesque, but when one wears an outfit that conveys misery or grievance, they are indeed a burden on society. By all accounts, the average customer in this line of outfits is a man who can exhibit cheerfulness while enduring crushing sorrow. He is not unlovable, and perhaps not as dashing as a soldier in uniform having returned from wringing the necks of foreigners, but he's close. Able to master any machine or animal, he may, at times, dig into his rucksack and, brandish a harmonica, play a lonely tune.~n~

For this reason we released our branded dynamite that is perfect for throwing. Whether attempting to rid of beaver mounds out of reach, large boulders precariously hanging over passes, or simply for the fisherman who does not have the patience or time to stare into the abyss for hours hoping to feed his family, our dynamite delivers.  It is able to be lit and thrown in a comfortable time frame towards the intended target, whether man or beast.

It is the best made gun for ducks, grouse, feral cats, dove, turkey, pheasant, partridge, quail, snipe, woodcock, raccoon, beaver, opossum, boar, hare, and especially chickens. It is the most desirable semi-auto shotgun ever sold. We cannot overemphasize the penetration. There are no possible complications in the operation of the apparatus, which is why this gun is so desired for penetration. The magazine holds several cartridges rather than just one shell in simpler shotgun models, ensuring that if inaccuracy plagues the shooter on the first few tries, repetition will result in success.~n~

They claimed local rancher Jim Gleeson had the stolen cattle and had killed the missing vaqueros. Marshall John Campbell emerged from the saloon where he was in the process of becoming heavily intoxicated. Words were exchanged between Gleeson and the Mexican gentlemen. Campbell's two pistols came out and he yelled, “Jim, I've got you covered!” He pulled the trigger and the gun jammed as he fell backwards and slumped against the saloon door. Gleeson went for his pistol and I aimed and shot it out of his hand, breaking his wrist. The Mexican gentlemen were satisfied and no blood was shed that day.”~n~

Riders say the smooth nature of the Trotter results in a much more comfortable ride than with other breeds. The breed is perfect as a riding horse covering long distances with a herd or as a carriage animal. Their ambling gait became known as the “fox trot.”~n~

So the manufacturing outfit of Peeters & Janssens, a company with a reputation for the fabrication of strictly high grade guns, set out to make a lightweight shotgun that is easy to use and conceal, as many situations in modern times require.~n~

Whereas other weapons require reloading, the user gains comfort in knowing that this good, powerful shotgun chambers even more shots. A man with more shells in the chamber means business. A man that has to take out his powder horn, wadding, and lead balls in order to load another shot is likely to be rushed by a crowd of half-crazed miscreants who know that you are momentarily defenseless. With the Lancaster Pump-Action Shotgun there will be no confusion about who is the one making the decisions, believe that.~n~

Then I spied down the river a piece some maidens who were doing the washing and hanging linens and laundry up to dry. I grabbed my Litchfield Rolling Block Rifle so I could obtain a better perspective. Imagine my sentiments when through the powerful lens atop that rifle I could see the washwomen were not only cleaning the clothes in the river, but had disrobed and were cleaning one another. I recognized one to be the handsome stable girl that worked at the Henderson's ranch. She had rejected my advances at the spring barn dance. Yet here she was, with four others, frolicking in birthday suits in the Tallahassee River. The thought crossed my mind to squeeze that trigger and insure my name would be remembered among the women of that valley for years to come. However I was so quaking in my excitement at what was unfolding in front of me I nary could have squeezed off an accurate shot.

0x0C8119FE // Descended from Gelderland and Groningen mares, the Dutch Warmblood is highly suited to farm and light draught work. They have long legs and an expressive head. They perform well in competition and exhibit an even temper and courageous spirit. Their stamina is high and, while not the fastest breed, they certainly have plenty of other traits that make this a superior work horse. Hot-blooded horses are more highly strung than cold-blooded ones, who are often larger, heavier horses suitable for tiring labor.~n~

John Hasstens from Oklahoma wrote to us to say “I taught my boy that all you need for happiness is a good horse, a good wife, and a good gun and when one gets ornery then you go sleep with the other one, and if they get really squirrely you can use one to help get rid of the other. My boy and I spend a lot of time discussin' such things and hunting. He is mighty proud of his Brun et Fabre.

Pa disappeared to the barn to try and save the herd. After he didn't return for a fortnight, I sat with the children and we enjoyed lard buttered bread into the evening while we took to singing aloud each page of your fine catalogue to pass the time. Our favorite entry was the Hutton & Baird Volcanic Pistol. When the storm broke after a week, Pa returned and was delighted and terrified by our children who could recite to song the specificity of every gun model. He later died of consumption and I married the local tobacconist.”

They are a bulky, heavyset breed capable of draft work, but they are also used as war horses due to their gait and disposition.

As carnivores, their diet consists of deer and mountain goats, as well as smaller animals like birds, beavers, and fish. As wolves often attack in packs, it is recommended that long range weapons like rifles, or a Bow with arrows, are used to wound or kill a wolf. Their meat can be used for food, and their pelts and hearts can be used for crafting.

The bloodline runs back many centuries. Indeed, the characteristic coat pattern is seen among cave drawings, leading some to conclude that the breed has been popular for quite some time.

The crimson color of the vest and your clever manner will surely enrage this guileless foe, causing them to ignore reason and forget the hand they have been dealt. Instead, they will act with folly, grimacing in shame and rage as you beam with gratified ambition and laugh at this delicate minded oaf now plundered of both room and board due to his foolish ways and ill-advised gambling prowess.~n~

Perfect for flushing out a cabin, teepee, rabbit warren, beaver mound, saloon or a group of bandits holed up in a cave.   It quickly renders wagons unsuitable for fleeing the scene of an altercation.  When used properly in conjunction with one of our repeating firearms it generates very satisfactory results.  Not to be sold to anyone under eight years of age.  Incendiary weapons are not a toy and should be used only as directed and permitted by laws of your state or territory.

The cost of the raw material and foreign labor is kept low so that we may pass the financial savings on to you after our one small percentage of profit. The gun factory is located near the Mexico border as a matter of economy and efficiency of labor. We are able to build this gun at lower wage scale than any other gun factory. If at any time it comes into question whether this repeating rifle is worth the price, which for many is over two weeks' wages, take into account that this one rifle is not only suitable for big game hunting, but does quick disposal of all manner of common pests, including land agents and tax men. You need only own one rifle and it is the Lancaster.~n~

He'd been bit by a coral snake some days before and was mighty weak with fever and hunger, as we had no provisions to speak of. It pained me to see that boy in such a state. We needed to get to a trading post or seek a physician. Time grew on and I soon came to love that boy, for he had worked hard for me and my family. I took solace in the fact that he would be dispatched to God with a high grade American made extra strong repeating rifle with the latest up to date features, and provide me nourishment to survive such a bitter winter.”~n~

Compare with any model on the market - The LeMat has always had a good reputation for providing extra firepower on the battlefield or in the brothel. T. Burn Russell wrote to us to say "I had the unfortunate encounter upon a man who exhibited simultaneous traits of ignorance and confidence as he attempted to loose my horse from the hitching post outside the place of worship in which I was attending. A young boy took notice and I confronted the would-be thief, who began firing a shotgun at me. We exchanged several rounds, and my LeMat had gone empty when he charged and knocked me to the ground, having full intention to kill me dead. I then remembered that there was a second barrel and, having fired that, shot him between the eyes, of great concern to his new widow."~n~

By unloading all eight cartridges into eight separate beer barrels, the crowd rushed to fill their glasses with the dispatching ale and rose a mug to one of Europe's finest armament manufacturers. This imported semi-auto pistol was demonstrated by Herr Janssens who visited our offices and outdoor shooting range – securing 49 of 50 shots at 100 yards even after several mugs of ale. In fact, the rapidity of fire from this firearm had all the boys in agreement that it is the greatest thing they ever had the pleasure of witnessing. The reloading is repeated as fast as one can pull the trigger so that the shooter can fire 8 shots in about half a second. Automatic pistols are mostly known to be used for civil life however they were quickly adopted by the Army for rousing enemies from the trenches. Fire one round and you will see – the recoil of this fine weapon

In fact, Aclin Banning of Texas wrote to us to say “I had a most terrible childhood, having been afflicted with polio. I suffered immensely and still find it quite difficult to walk or use my left arm. However I found the Buck Cattleman Revolver easy to use when my family was taken from me one night last March. Having a terrible feud with our neighbors for as far as anyone can care to remember, they came and accused us of grazing cattle on their pasture and soiling the river. My Pa got into some very terse words and shots rang out from their side. I hobbled to the porch and fanned that revolver with my crippled left arm, and left them dead and dying where they once stood. I cannot thank you enough for the propitious extent of this fine revolver.”~n~

In the past, dispatching these animals required a crude slingshot, bow and arrow, or flinging firepots full of pitch or disease.

They are fast, quick to learn, and have a willingness for training, though they will not tolerate abuse. Good-natured, they form a tight bond with humans, having been bred for desert living where they are required to live on little food and be exposed to extreme fluctuations in temperature. Whether used for racing, war, or work, they are superior in fitness, strength and agility and exhibit a high amount of grit. Requires a great deal of care, but the owner is rewarded for it.~n~

For many weeks I sat at the ready, running my calloused hands up and down the barrel of my Litchfield Repeating rifle and singing a song of cavalry and blood of the lamb softly to myself. They think me to be fat and plain. When they came to rattle through my belongings and divide up my possessions among themselves, imagine their surprise when I emerged from a barrel and proceeded to drop each of them where they stood. I do not tolerate thieves and will keep this Litchfield Repeater by my side until the last breath rattles out of me.”~n~
